Broker: Call to Arms
====================

A Data Broker addon for showing you what dungeons/Looking For Raids will get you rewards right now. This addon constantly checks the LFG panel for potential bonus loot for the roles you're capable of queuing for.

It needs an LDB display addon to function. I recommend ChocolateBar.

The broker data display shows how many Random Dungeons are offering a bonus reward for your role right now, as well as how many Looking For Raid instances offer a bonus reward for your role right now.

Get it on [WoW Interface](https://wowinterface.com/downloads/info25623-BrokerCalltoArms), [Wago](https://addons.wago.io/addons/broker-call-to-arms), or use the [Cursebreaker tool](https://github.com/AcidWeb/CurseBreaker) (recommended)
